You can think of Alien Die as:
- a keychain that glows with old-fashioned animated LEDs,
- or a coin-cell powered pocket toy,
- or a fidget ~~spinner~~ clicker, because it has nicely clicking tactile buttons,
- or a nicely looking aide for your board games,
- or a secret messenger.

It's firmware contains:
- a Tic-tac-toe pvp game.
- a puzzle,
- a small screen saver,
- an animation player
- an animation editor,
- a timer,
- a playing die
- a set of 9 heads-or-tails coins

Last three apps help with board games.

- a small PCB board,
- a tiny microcontroller,
- 9 buttons,
- a bunch of LEDs,
- and a CR2335 battery holder.
